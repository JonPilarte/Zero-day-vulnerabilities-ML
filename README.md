# Zero-day-vulnerabilities-ML
Cyber-Security project on “Forecasting Zero-Day vulnerabilities using ML” (Prep, Samp, GA) <br />
• Compared two final Pipelines, one with an 85% lower computational cost than the other <br />
• Pipeline 1 outperformed Pipeline 2 when provided with equal computational resources <br />
• Obtained 99% accuracy and achieved superior results with less training generations (5 vs 15) <br />
